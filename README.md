# AI-Powered Smart Assessment and Feedback System

## 🔍 Overview
This project aims to revolutionize student assessments by using AI to provide real-time feedback for multiple-choice questions and programming tasks. It not only shows the correct answer but explains the reasoning step-by-step. For programming, it helps debug code, highlights errors, and suggests optimized solutions — all tailored to the learner’s level.

## 💡 Features
- Personalized feedback for MCQs with step-by-step explanations
- AI-assisted debugging for code in multiple languages
- Multi-language programming support (Python, Java, C++, etc.)
- Error analysis and learning suggestions
- Student-level adaptive solution explanation
- Cloud integration for scalability
